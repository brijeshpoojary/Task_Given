Hey

So you need to run a query and get:-
district,
block,
cluster,
school code,
school name,
medium of instruction,
student id,
student gender,
mother tongue,
class  section (concatenated),
program name,
assessment name,
question name,
answer:- (use: case when se.status=-99999 then 'AB' when se.status=-1 then 'NA' else cast(se."answerScore" as text))

so get this information for 
block id:- 586
and assessment id :- 120
